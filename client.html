		<p> 
			In 1998, Ross started SureLock Storage with nothing more than a box, a lock, and a dream. <br> Ross would go down to the local YMCA and charge gym goers 2 dollars to put their stuff in his box. <br> 20 years later and SureLock Storage is now one of the leading companies in self-storage, with over 50 containers worldwide.
		<br>
		<br>
			Our mission is to provide reliable, secure, and easily accessible storage solutions at an affordable rate
		<br>
		<br>
			Our vision is to continuously invest in innovative storage technology and to expand our network of storage facilities.

		<h1> Project Description </h1>
		<p>
			SureLock Storage is looking for a software system to manage our storage units more efficiently. Currently, we gather our clients’ information on site and through email and we use Microsoft Excel to track data such as payment info, balance, and unit cost.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			As our company is growing at a very fast rate, we have discovered several problems with our current system: 
		</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Difficult to keep track of the clients’ payment status</li>
			<li>Difficult to know where in the storage facility each client’s unit is located</li>
			<li>There is no way to see a client's payment history or how long they have been renting a storage unit</li>
			</ul>
		<p>
			A new system is required in order to save time and money. Currently, a large amount of time is spent cross referencing a whiteboard and excel sheet to ensure that no payments are missed. With all the information in one easily accessible place, that time can be used to acquire new clients and manage current client needs
