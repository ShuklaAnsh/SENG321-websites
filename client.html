		<h1> Project Description </h1>
		<p>
			Surelock Storage is looking for a software system to manage our storage units more efficiently. Currently, we handle our customer’s information on site and through email, and track data such as payment info, balance, and unit cost using Microsoft Excel.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			As our company is growing at a very fast rate, we have discovered several problems with our current system: 
			<ul>
			<li>Hard to keep track of who has paid and who hasn’t</li>
			<li>Very difficult to know where in the facility each user’s storage unit is.</li>
			<li>There is no way to see the history of a user’s payments or how long they have been renting a unit for.</li>
			</ul>
			We would like to be able to store data for up to two years, and would to be able to search a user by last name and to see all of the information about their unit, including the outstanding balance.
